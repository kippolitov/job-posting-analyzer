# Implementation Plan: Companion Web Application with Document-Upload Analysis

**Branch**: `004-web-companion-app` | **Date**: 2026-07-21 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)

**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/004-web-companion-app/spec.md`

## Summary

Add a third monorepo package, `web/` — a static React 18 + TypeScript 5 (strict) + Tailwind SPA built with Vite — that signs users in with Google Identity Services (GIS) and reads/writes the **same** server-side account data as the extension. Library, profile, and account views are pure consumers of the existing `/api/profile`, `/api/jobs`, and `/api/account` endpoints (no backend changes); search / filter / sort / side-by-side comparison run client-side over the fetched library. One genuinely new capability — **document-upload analysis** — is a single new Functions endpoint, `POST /api/analyze-document`, that extracts text from an uploaded `.docx`/`.pdf` server-side, validates it (magic-byte sniff, 10 MB cap, encrypted / image-only rejection) **before** consuming allowance, then reuses the existing metering service and analyze orchestrator unchanged. Saved document-sourced analyses get a small `SavedJobs` schema extension (a `source` discriminator, `filename`, and a synthetic dedupe key). The entire backend auth delta is two lines of policy: widen the token `aud` check to a set of client IDs and add a CORS origin allowlist. Deployment publishes the SPA to a dedicated **Azure Static Web Apps (Free tier)** resource — a deliberate, documented exception to the "no new Azure resources" habit from 002/003, now governed by constitution Principle V (Cost Discipline): the Free tier is $0 and closes a real gap GitHub Pages could not (response-header/CSP control for an authenticated surface). GitHub Pages continues to host the marketing landing page, legal pages, and coverage reports — only the authenticated app moves.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x (strict) on both sides; Node 20 for Azure Functions; React 18 in `web/`.

**Primary Dependencies**:
- `web/`: React 18, Vite, Tailwind CSS, React Router (HashRouter), `google-accounts` / GIS script (loaded from Google, not bundled), MSW (dev/test only).
- `functions/` new runtime deps (the feature's **only** additions to the zero-new-deps posture, documented in research.md R6): `mammoth` (.docx text extraction) and `unpdf` (.pdf text extraction, serverless-friendly pdfjs wrapper). No new dep for type sniffing (manual magic-byte check) or multipart (native `request.formData()`).

**Storage**: Existing Azure Table Storage (`Users`, `Usage`, `SavedJobs`, `Profile`). No new tables. Uploaded document bytes are **never persisted** — held in memory for extraction only.

**Testing**: Vitest everywhere; Azurite table integration tests for the new endpoint's metering interaction; real `.docx`/`.pdf` fixtures driven through the true extraction path; MSW contract tests in `web/`. ≥80% changed-module coverage bar (constitution QG-2).

**Target Platform**: Azure Static Web Apps (Free tier) at its own origin (SPA, clean-path routing); Azure Functions (Linux, Node 20) for the API. Web views must be fully usable on mobile viewports.

**Project Type**: Monorepo with three packages — `extension/` (WXT), `functions/` (Azure Functions), `web/` (new Vite SPA) — plus a new shared-types location both `extension/` and `web/` import.

**Performance Goals**: Document analysis shares the analyze path budget — ≤ 8 s p50, 30 s ceiling (constitution QG-4) — with text extraction adding a sub-second budget at the 10 MB cap. Any operation > 300 ms shows a progress indicator (constitution III). Landing + library first render usable on a mobile viewport.

**Constraints**: Azure Static Web Apps' `navigationFallback` rewrites unknown paths to `index.html`, so the app uses **clean-path routing** (`BrowserRouter`), superseding research R1's original hash-routing decision (see R1 addendum). Functions process memory ceiling 512 MB (constitution IV) bounds in-memory PDF parsing at 10 MB. GIS ID tokens live ~1 hour and are held **in memory only, never localStorage** (research R2). Backend auth delta limited to: `aud` set + CORS allowlist naming the Static Web Apps origin (research R3). Hosting exception governed by constitution Principle V (Cost Discipline): Free tier, $0, no metered overage risk at this traffic scale.

**Scale/Scope**: Per-user library ≤ 1,000 postings (premium cap) — comfortably within client-side search/filter/sort/compare over a single fetched list. Single new endpoint; ~6 new web views (landing, library, posting detail, compare, profile, account, upload/analyze).

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Derived from `.specify/memory/constitution.md` v1.1.0:

| Principle | Gate | Status |
|-----------|------|--------|
| **I. Code Quality** | Meaningful naming, no dead code, single responsibility, review before merge. Shared analysis/job types extracted to one location — no duplication between `extension/` and `web/`. | ✅ PASS — extraction of shared types actively removes duplication; new endpoint is one focused handler delegating to existing services. |
| **II. Testing Standards** | Test-first (Red-Green-Refactor); ≥80% coverage on changed modules; integration tests use real fixtures/stubs not hollow mocks; E2E covers every P1 journey. | ✅ PASS — plan mandates real `.docx`/`.pdf` fixtures through the true extraction path, Azurite metering integration tests (reject-before-increment + parallel races), MSW contract tests; P1 (sign-in + see shared data) gets an E2E path. |
| **III. UX Consistency** | Progress indicator for > 300 ms ops; plain-language errors + next action, no raw traces; stable terminology; WCAG 2.1 AA labels/contrast. | ✅ PASS — upload/analyze and library fetch show progress; all validation/quota/cap errors are plain-language with an action (reuses 003's exact messages); web reuses the extension's design tokens for consistent terminology; a11y labels required on interactive elements. |
| **IV. Performance** | Analysis ≤ 30 s; UI async/non-blocking; ≤ 512 MB memory; reject ≥ 20% p95 regression. | ✅ PASS — document path shares the analyze budget + sub-second extraction; upload/analyze is async with progress; 10 MB cap enforced at the boundary bounds memory; no change to the analyze latency path itself. |
| **V. Cost Discipline** | New infrastructure MUST default to a genuinely free tier; a new resource is justified only when it closes a real capability gap the zero-resource baseline can't. | ✅ PASS — Azure Static Web Apps Free tier is $0 with no time limit; adopted specifically to gain response-header/CSP control GitHub Pages could not provide for an authenticated surface (see Security review addendum below). |

**Quality Gates**: QG-1 (lint zero-warnings — `web/` gets its own lint gate in ci.yml), QG-2 (≥80% coverage — enforced in ci.yml for `web/`), QG-3 (UX review of error/loading states), QG-4 (latency benchmark — document path inherits the analyze scenario budget).

**Development Workflow**: Feature branch `004-web-companion-app` ✅; dependency additions (`mammoth`, `unpdf`) isolated and documented as the deliberate zero-new-deps exception (research R6); docs updated in-PR (contracts/ + quickstart.md).

**Result**: No violations. Complexity Tracking table omitted (nothing to justify). A third monorepo package is an extension of the existing two-package layout, not new architectural complexity.

```

**Structure Decision**: Three-package monorepo. `web/` is a standalone Vite SPA deployed to its own **Azure Static Web Apps (Free tier)** origin with clean-path routing; `shared/` holds the analysis/job TypeScript types and design tokens that both `extension/` and `web/` import (replacing the current duplication between `extension/types/job.ts` and `functions/src/models/job.ts`). GitHub Pages continues to serve the marketing landing page, legal pages, and coverage reports — unrelated to the authenticated app, which now lives at a dedicated origin. All backend work is additive except two small policy edits (`auth.ts` aud-set, `http.ts` CORS allowlist naming the Static Web Apps origin) and one small model/repository extension for document-sourced saved jobs.

## Complexity Tracking

No constitution violations — table omitted.
